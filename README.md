# Processor for Simple Load/Store Architecture

This was a project I made for the Digital Computing course at PUC-Rio in 2020.2.
We had to build a processor for a simple load/store architecture in the VHDL language.
We were able to simulate this functioning of this processor by using [Xilinx ISE Webpack Design Suite](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html).
If you want to know more about the project, this repository a detailed [report](Report.pdf) in Portuguese.
